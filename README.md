## Hello everyone ‚úåüèº

My name is Jaime and I love make things, specially when techonolgy is involved. 
I'm from M√©xico city and I born in 1995 in a little place in Puebla, M√©xico call Atzitzintla. I started work in techonology when I was nineteen. Autodidact.

Currenty I working as Software Architect at [Osmos](https://osmos.mx) building things to make payroll easy and configurable, also make it fast and scalable from one to thousands of human resources in your company. 

Right know I'm taking a Linux Foundation course for Kubernetes for Devlelopers, just to survey me into more "cloud" stacks, because I learn that cloud is not only make EC2 instances in AWS and put the code there and use Docker to set local stacks for development. Cloud is insance I hope build things with that kind of infrastructure, specially becauase comes with great scalability and performance requirements.

My favorite programming languages to make things are Java and PHP ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm a Symfony framework lover. When I have some free time will see what happens with his certification üòä
I like to build software that scale as God commands, specially when concurrent things are involved. 

I'm a frustrate writer because last year and this days I dont' have enough time to share the things I learn through the time, but I writed some post at [Medium](https://medium.com/@jaimeramirezc) that shows some basic things to do in Symfony. 


See you soon with more new things that I will share with you in spanish content. 


Jaime.
